# Startup Success Prediction

This notebook aims to develop a ranking model that can predict the success of startups, using data available in the Startup Success Predict 100 dataset, available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishkc06/startup-success- prediction.
The classification model will be built using machine learning algorithms, DecisionTreeClassifier and LogisticRegression. In addition, data pre-processing techniques will be used to select the most relevant variables and deal with missing or inconsistent values.

Exploratory data analysis will be performed to identify possible relationships between the variables and the success of startups. The objective is to identify patterns and trends that may be useful for building the classification model.
